The first of manymore!
Hello World,
It seems I'm now studying a bit more about programming which I hope will bring a lot of benefits to my career!
This my first interaction with GitHub that apparently is a repository for coding as well as a place for people to manage and centralize the content for their projects.
Excited to start doing this!
Best,
Vitor.
